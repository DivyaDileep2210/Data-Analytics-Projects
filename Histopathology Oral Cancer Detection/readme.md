## PROJECT TITLE : 
HISTOPATHOLOGY ORAL CANCER PREDICTION 🦷
## INTRODUCTION :
Histopathology oral cancer detection using CNN involves training a deep learning model (CNN) on a large dataset of histopathological images of oral tissues. The CNN learns to recognize patterns and features indicative of cancerous or non-cancerous tissues. After training, the model can assist pathologists by quickly and accurately identifying oral cancer in new biopsy samples.
## FEATURES :
📍 High Accuracy<br>
📍 Rapid Analysis<br>
📍 Consistency<br>
📍 Potential for early detection<br>
📍 Scalability<br>
## INSTALLATION :
➡Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account<br>
➡Create a new Colab Notebook<br>
➡Import appropriate packages<br>
## USAGE :
➡Preprocess Data: Download the dataset and perform data preprocessing.<br>
➡Train Model: Use provided notebooks to train the CNN model.<br>
➡Load Pre-trained Model (Optional):Load pre-trained model.<br>
➡Detect Oral Cancer:Apply the trained model for oral cancer detection on new images.<br>
➡Test and Evaluate:Evaluate model performance.<br>
