## PROJECT TITLE : 
HISTOPATHOLOGY ORAL CANCER PREDICTION 🦷
## INTRODUCTION :
Histopathology oral cancer detection using CNN involves training a deep learning model (CNN) on a large dataset of histopathological images of oral tissues. The CNN learns to recognize patterns and features indicative of cancerous or non-cancerous tissues. After training, the model can assist pathologists by quickly and accurately identifying oral cancer in new biopsy samples.
## FEATURES :
📍 High Accuracy<br>
📍 Rapid Analysis<br>
📍 Consistency<br>
📍 Potential for early detection<br>
📍 Scalability<br>
