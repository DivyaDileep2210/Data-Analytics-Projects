# PROJECT TITLE : HISTOPATHOLOGY ORAL CANCER PREDICTION
# PROJECT OVERVIEW : Histopathology oral cancer detection using CNN involves training a deep learning model (CNN) on a large dataset of histopathological images of oral tissues. The CNN learns to recognize patterns and features indicative of cancerous or non-cancerous tissues. After training, the model can assist pathologists by quickly and accurately identifying oral cancer in new biopsy samples.
