## PROJECT TITLE : 
HISTOPATHOLOGY ORAL CANCER PREDICTION 🦷
## INTRODUCTION :
Histopathology oral cancer detection using CNN involves training a deep learning model (CNN) on a large dataset of histopathological images of oral tissues. The CNN learns to recognize patterns and features indicative of cancerous or non-cancerous tissues. After training, the model can assist pathologists by quickly and accurately identifying oral cancer in new biopsy samples.
## FEATURES :
📍 High Accuracy<br>
📍 Rapid Analysis<br>
📍 Consistency<br>
📍 Potential for early detection<br>
📍 Scalability<br>
## INSTALLATION :
➡Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account<br>
➡Create a new Colab Notebook<br>
➡Import appropriate packages<br>
## USAGE :
➡Preprocess Data: Download the dataset and perform data preprocessing.<br>
➡Train Model: Use provided notebooks to train the CNN model.<br>
➡Detect Oral Cancer:Apply the trained model for oral cancer detection on new images.<br>
➡Test and Evaluate:Evaluate model performance.<br>
## DATA 📑 :
The Histopathology oral cancer dataset is taken from Kaggle (www.kaggle.com.)<br>
Histopathology oral cancer detection datasets typically consist of medical images of oral tissues obtained from biopsy samples. The images may be in formats like JPEG, PNG, or DICOM, and they come with annotations indicating whether the tissue is cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).
