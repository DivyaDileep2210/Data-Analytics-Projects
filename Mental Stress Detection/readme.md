## PROJECT TITLE🖋 : 
MENTAL STRESS DETECTION 👩‍⚕️
## INTRODUCTION :
Mental stress detection using machine learning involves the application of various algorithms and techniques to analyze data related to an individual's behavior, physiological signals, or speech patterns to identify patterns indicative of mental stress.
## FEATURES :
One of the special features in mental stress detection using machine learning is "Heart Rate Variability" (HRV). HRV refers to the variation in time intervals between successive heartbeats. It is an essential indicator of the autonomic nervous system's activity, which is influenced by an individual's stress levels.
By analyzing HRV dynamics, machine learning models can detect subtle changes in heart rhythm patterns associated with mental stress. Lower HRV is often linked to higher stress levels, while higher HRV is associated with a more relaxed state.
Incorporating HRV as a feature allows the model to capture stress-related physiological changes, providing valuable insights into an individual's stress levels and overall well-being. This special feature enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of mental stress detection systems, contributing to better understanding and management of stress-related issues.
## INSTALLATION :
✅Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account<br>
✅Create a new Colab Notebook<br>
✅Import appropriate packages<br>
## USAGE :
✅Data Collection: Gather data from various sources, such as physiological sensors (e.g., heart rate monitors, EEG devices), facial expression analysis, speech recordings, and self-reported assessments.<br>
✅Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the collected data that can capture patterns related to stress, such as heart rate variability, facial action units, acoustic features from speech, etc.<br>
✅Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize the features, and prepare it for machine learning algorithms.<br>
✅Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, deep learning models) suitable for the type of data and stress detection task.<br>
✅Model Training: Train the selected machine learning model on a labeled dataset, using a portion of the collected data.<br>
✅Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model on a separate, unseen test dataset using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.<br>
## DATA 📑 :
The SWELL is a dataset for research on stress and user modelling. The dataset is taken from Kaggle(www.kaggle.com) . This dataset was collected in an experiment, in which 25 people performed typical knowledge work (writing reports, making presentations, reading email, searching for information). By manipulating their working conditions with the stressors: email interruptions and time pressure. A varied set of data was recorded: computer logging, facial expression from camera recordings, body postures from a Kinect 3D sensor and heart rate (variability) and skin conductance from body sensors.
## CONFIGURATIONS :
🟡Feature Selection: Decide which features to include in the analysis. You can choose from physiological signals, facial expressions, speech features, or any other relevant data sources. Feature selection helps to focus on the most informative aspects related to stress.<br>
🟡Feature Engineering: Transform raw data into meaningful features that can be fed into the machine learning model. Feature engineering might involve statistical calculations, time-domain or frequency-domain analysis, or other data transformations.<br>
🟡Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and noise. Common techniques include normalization, standardization, or imputation.<br>
🟡Model Selection: Choose the appropriate machine learning algorithm for stress detection. Consider different models like SVM, random forests, or deep learning models, and select the one that suits your data and problem.<br>
🟡Training and Test Split: Divide the data into training and test sets for model evaluation. Common splits include 70/30 or 80/20 ratios, but cross-validation can also be used for better evaluation.<br>
🟡Model Evaluation Metrics: Choose appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to assess the model's performance. Consider the specific requirements and objectives of the stress detection application.
